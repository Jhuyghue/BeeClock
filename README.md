## About
**BeeClock** is an attempt to recreate desktop clocks and make them work on modern platforms using Python. The clocks were just a extra thing that came on the second disc that you can just install and have on your computer and have it as a fun novelty. I got the existing sprites from the second disc from TwinBee Paradise in Donburi Shima and tried to remake the code based on how an actual analog clock works while implementing the assets with them. This project is aimed to make use of the basic Pygame features, bringing back this old application back to life on Windows 10/11, and enhance it with any features that can be better for most modern operating systems. 

## Installation 
> [!WARNING]
> This software is only compatible in Windows since it uses **WIN32API** and it will not work in Mac/Linux.

**Right-Click:** Change clock themes

## Libraries Used
[**Pygame:**](https://github.com/pygame/pygame.git) a free and open source Python library that allows you to make video games. <br>
[**Pywin32:**](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32.git) a Python library that allows use for Windows API.
