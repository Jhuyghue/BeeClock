## About
**BeeClock** is an attempt to recreate desktop clocks and make them work on modern platforms using Python. The clocks were just a extra thing that came on the second disc that you can just install and have on your computer and have it as a fun novelty. I got the existing sprites from the second disc from TwinBee Paradise in Donburi Shima and tried to remake the code based on how an actual analog clock works while implementing the assets with them. This project is aimed to make use of the basic Pygame features, bringing back this old application back to life on Windows 10/11, and enhance it with any features that can be better for most modern operating systems. 

## Installation 
1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Pygame already installed in your Python enviroment. If not, you can also use pip for the terminal:
 ```bash
 pip install pygame
 ```
Install Python's **WIN32API** to to the terminal:
```
pip install pywin32
```
> [!WARNING]
> This software is only compatible in Windows since it uses **WIN32API** and it will not work in Mac/Linux.

2. Clone the repo, get the directory, then run the file:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jhuyghue/BeeClock.git
cd beeclock
python beeclock.py
```

## Controls 
**Spacebar:** Switches the frame to no frame on the window <br>
**Right-Click:** Change clock themes

## Libraries Used
[**Pygame:**](https://github.com/pygame/pygame.git) a free and open source Python library that allows you to make video games. <br>
[**Pywin32:**](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32.git) a Python library that allows use for Windows API.
